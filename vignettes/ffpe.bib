	abstract = {{{\textless}AbstractText} {Label="BACKGROUND"} {NlmCategory="BACKGROUND"{\textgreater}We} have developed a gene expression assay {(Whole-Genome} {DASL)}, capable of generating whole-genome gene expression profiles from degraded samples such as formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded {(FFPE)} {specimens.{\textless}/AbstractText{\textgreater}}
{{\textless}AbstractText} {Label="METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL} {FINDINGS"} {NlmCategory="RESULTS"{\textgreater}We} demonstrated a similar level of sensitivity in gene detection between matched fresh-frozen {(FF)} and {FFPE} samples, with the number and overlap of probes detected in the {FFPE} samples being approximately 88\% and 95\% of that in the corresponding {FF} samples, respectively; 74\% of the differentially expressed probes overlapped between the {FF} and {FFPE} pairs. The {WG-DASL} assay is also able to detect 1.3-1.5 and 1.5-2 -fold changes in intact and {FFPE} samples, respectively. The dynamic range for the assay is approximately 3 logs. Comparing the {WG-DASL} assay with an in vitro transcription-based labeling method yielded fold-change correlations of R(2) approximately 0.83, while fold-change comparisons with quantitative {RT-PCR} assays yielded R(2) approximately 0.86 and R(2) approximately 0.55 for intact and {FFPE} samples, respectively. Additionally, the {WG-DASL} assay yielded high self-correlations {(R(2)\&gt;0.98)} with low intact {RNA} inputs ranging from 1 ng to 100 ng; reproducible expression profiles were also obtained with 250 pg total {RNA} {(R(2)} approximately 0.92), with approximately 71\% of the probes detected in 100 ng total {RNA} also detected at the 250 pg level. When {FFPE} samples were assayed, 1 ng total {RNA} yielded self-correlations of R(2) approximately 0.80, while still maintaining a correlation of R(2) approximately 0.75 with standard {FFPE} inputs (200 {ng).{\textless}/AbstractText{\textgreater}}
{{\textless}AbstractText} {Label="CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE"} {NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS"{\textgreater}Taken} together, these results show that {WG-DASL} assay provides a reliable platform for genome-wide expression profiling in archived materials. It also possesses utility within clinical settings where only limited quantities of samples may be available (e.g. microdissected material) or when minimally invasive procedures are performed (e.g. biopsied {specimens).{\textless}/AbstractText{\textgreater}}},
